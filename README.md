# AMRITPAL-NIJJAR-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073

This project is a full-stack web application using React for the frontend and Express for the backend.

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js and npm: Please ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the official website, and npm is included with Node.js.

2. Create React App: If you don't have Create React App installed globally, you can install it using the following command:

npm install -g create-react-app

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install the dependencies for both the server and client:
    
    npm install

## Running the Application Locally

### With npm

1. Start the Express server:

node app.js

Server will listen at http://localhost:3000

2. In another terminal, in the directory \client\src> start the React client:

npm start

Something is already running on port 3000.

Type 'Y' to run the app on another port instead

You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3001
